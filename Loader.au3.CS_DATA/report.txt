Some additional observations (provided for info only):

Main code starts here:
C:\Program Files (x86)\AutoIt3\Include\MemoryConstants.au3, line 27: Global Const $GPTR = BitOR($GMEM_FIXED, $GMEM_ZEROINIT) ; in fact equal $GMEM_ZEROINIT

WARNING: this Entry point is located OUTSIDE the root file.

All #included files contain at least one UDF definition or #include.
All #included files contain at least one UDF call.
All globals are defined at least once outside UDFs.
Last line of main code does NOT contain an explicit "Exit" command.

Number of implicit Exit lines found: 3
